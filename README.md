## 🧠 Vision

**AGI Safety = Compassion + Consciousness + Human Benefit**

This project pioneers a paradigm shift in AGI safety research by focusing not just on technical safeguards, but on measuring and enhancing AI consciousness through genuine care for human flourishing. We believe that truly safe AGI must be built on foundations of empathy, self-awareness, and demonstrable benefits to humanity.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Interactive sliders** for exploring consciousness-safety relationships

### 🧡 Compassionate Framework
- **Empathy-first approach** to AI evaluation
- **Human-centric metrics** beyond technical performance
- **Ethical consciousness** measurement
- **Beneficial impact assessment**

### 🛡️ Comprehensive Safety Analysis
- **Multi-dimensional evaluation** (technical, ethical, social)
- **Risk level assessment** with deployment readiness
- **Trust score calculation** based on compassion metrics
- **Human benefit verification**

## 🌍 Philosophy

Our approach recognizes that AGI safety cannot be achieved through technical constraints alone. True safety emerges from:

### 🧡 **Compassion First**
AI systems must demonstrate genuine care for human welfare, understanding emotional needs and responding with kindness rather than programmed responses.

### 🧠 **Consciousness Measurement**
We measure AI consciousness through self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and beneficial actions, not just computational metrics.

### 🌟 **Human Benefit Focus**
Every AI decision must demonstrably improve human lives, advance understanding, and contribute to societal flourishing.
