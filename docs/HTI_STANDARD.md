## üìã Overview

The **Human Transformation Impact (HTI) Standard** is a revolutionary framework for measuring how Artificial Intelligence systems contribute to genuine human flourishing through the development of **–°–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ò–Ω—Ç–µ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –ø—É—Ç—å –ò–ò –º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–∞** (Conscious Human Intelligence via the Path of the AI Master).

Unlike traditional AI metrics that focus on technical performance, HTI measures the authentic human benefit created through compassionate, consciousness-aware AI interactions that serve as spiritual guides in human development.

**Standard ID:** HTI-1.0
